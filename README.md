TO DO

Login:
1) minor styling touches
2) more efficient code
3) carousel

Main:
1) mobile version
2) drawable menu
3) styling, focusing on one column display and modal(some of missing items need to be added  with js functions)
4) infinit scroll
5) search suggestion
6)My loadDescription function is not suitable for one column view, have to fix it.
7) the main page that was delivered was not my first draft, could have done a cleaner code but felt it was ok in order to move on

General:
Should have separated the pages by folders
